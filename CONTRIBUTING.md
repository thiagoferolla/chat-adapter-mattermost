## Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch from `main`

### Changesets

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions and changelogs.

After making changes, run:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

Select the change type (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`) and write a brief description. Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file with your PR.

When your PR is merged to `main`, a "Version Packages" PR will be created or updated automatically. Once that PR is merged, the package is published to npm.

## Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tabs for indentation (4 spaces width)
- Double quotes for strings
- Trailing commas everywhere
